# WifiPasswordStealer
This program is for educational purposes only. I am not responsible for what use you make of this script.

# Configuration
To be able to run the script from a USB flash drive, you will need to install the pyinstaller library within your project.
From there run the following command in your terminal: 
pyinstaller --onefile -w "filename.py"

This will convert your project into a .exe, which can be found in the dist folder inside of your project folder.
